Which language to use for gameplay code? 

c++:

+1 I am already an expert with C++, and C++ is already used for engine

+1 much better editor than lua/rust

+3 debugger with editor integration vastly better than lua/rust

+1 built in profiler in VS with editor integration

-1 header/src is irritating shit

6

rust

+3 better lang than lua/c++

+1 more enjoyable to write, since less legacy BS in lang

+1 safe from some errors that C++ is not

-1 terrible C API required to communicate with C++ engine

4

lua
+1 already integrated into project

+1 easy to write

-1 dynamically typed, code can be wrong, but it isn't immediatly obvious

+1 fastest compilation

-1 worst performance of the lot

+1 easiest for users to script 

2

It seems I should use C++ based on these results:(
